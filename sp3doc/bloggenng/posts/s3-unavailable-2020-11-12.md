## S3 downtime on 12th of Nov 2020

Posted on 2020-10-27

The S3 storage we are presently using for catsup will be unavailable on the 12th of Nov 2020 due to scheduled networking hardware replacement.

This will affect both uploading data to S3, and fetching data from S3. Data already fetched from S3 may still work, since the fetch creates a copy.
