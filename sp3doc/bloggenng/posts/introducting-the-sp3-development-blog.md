## Introducing the SP3 development blog

Posted by Denis on 2020-10-25

Following the weekly meeting, we thought it would be useful to write a blog.

This blog will contain:

- Updates on changes we're making
- Introduction to new features
- Writing on problems encountered

We will aim to post one update per week, hopefully at the end of Monday, to allow people to read it for the meeting on Wednesday.
